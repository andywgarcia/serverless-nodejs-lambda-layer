# serverless-nodejs-lambda-layer

This repository is a very basic example of a lambda layer with a normal function in node js.

I originally couldn't figure out how to do a lambda layer without publishing to npm first, but here it is.

The folder structure of "your-lambda-layer/nodejs/node_modules/your-custom-package-name" must be exact and the package name folder must have the updated package.json file inside of it.
